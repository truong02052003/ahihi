                    <p>
                        <b>Rainwater Harvesting</b> is a technology used to collect, convey and store rainwater from relatively clean surfaces like the roof, rock catchment or land surface 
                        <span>&minus;</span> essentially for later use. This collected rainwater is either directed to recharge groundwater or stored in a rainwater tank. <br /><br />
                        <b>Rainwater Harvesting</b> isn<span>&#39;</span>t some modern technology, it has been practiced for over 4000 years throughout the world.

                    <p>
                        Rainwater harvesting systems can be purchased complete from various home improvement stores. Below are some of the <b>techniques</b> for rainwater harvesting.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>1. Rainwater Barrels: </b> A barrel installed underneath the downspout to funnel rainwater from the roof.</p>

                    <p><b>2. Dry System: </b> An improvement to the rainwater barrel technique in terms of size.</p>

                    <p><b>3. Wet System: </b> Collection pipes are located underground and always full of water.</p>

                    <p><b>4. Green Roof: </b> A roof that enables plants to use rainwater instantly.</p>

                    <p><b>5. Retention Ponds: </b> Ponds used to collect surface runoff for groundwater recharge or irrigation.</p>

                    <p><b>6. Permeable Pavers: </b> A system that stores water by allowing stormwater runoff to infiltrate through porous surfaces.</p>
